  <sd_space_double_bed.label>space double bed</sd_space_double_bed.label>
  <sd_space_double_bed.description>A comfy bed. Fits two. On the task of "going to space" this bed was literally first developed as a small spacecraft. After this fatal first mistake the possibility to sleep inside and a bit more comfort was added. This didn't prevent the advertising agency from using the terms "fly in your sleep" and "sleeping on clouds". After several lawsuits from customers with strange injuries the advertisment changed to a more down-to-earth direction.</sd_space_double_bed.description>
